## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

In the file `index.html` there is a sample page.

Use appropriate selectors to add a yellow semi-transparent background for the subsequent elements. After checking that a particular selector is working, try to change the background for the next one (not for all of them at once):

- `h2` placed directly in `div.module`
- `div`s placed directly in `div.module`
- `h2` in divs that are placed directly in `div.module`
- `p` placed directly after the `h2` that is placed directly in `div.module`
- only the third `p` placed after the `h2` that is placed directly in `div.module`
- all `p` placed after the first `h2` (but not those in the nested `div`)
- `h2` placed only in the first `div`
- the first `p` after the `h2` that is placed in the last `div`


## Exercise 2

In the `index.html` file there is a banner, which is styled in the `css/style.css` file. Unfortunately the styling does not work properly, because the banner should have white font color. Use the debugger to check which part of the style is not working and try to fix the problem by changing styles. Solve the issue in the style file only.


## Exercise 3

The file `index.html` contains a paragraph that was also styled incorrectly. The paragraph should have a dark background (`#333`) and white font.
Look at the styles in file `css/style.css` and correct the styling. Avoid using tag selectors.
