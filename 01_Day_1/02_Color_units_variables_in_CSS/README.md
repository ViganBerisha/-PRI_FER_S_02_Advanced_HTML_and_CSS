## Exercise 1

Create a `div` **320x320px** using the `em` unit which will have:

- transparent red background,
- blue and 8px thick border

Save the colors as **variables** in some parent element (e.g. `:root`) and then use them for styling.


## Exercise 2

Create a div element with class `.parent` and give it the following properties:

- width **500px**,
- height **100px**,
- gradient background - from **red** to **blue** (given in HSL).


Inside the div `.parent` create another block element with class `.children` and with the following properties:

- width **50%**,
- height **50vh**,
- background color **green** (in RGB).


## Exercise 3

Change the text size for `body` to `10px` and then create 3 divs:

The first one with class `.element1` which will have:

- height and width `150px`;
- margin `10px`;
- red background.

The second element with class `.element2` that will have:

- same size and margin as above but given in `em`;
- blue background.

The third element with class `.element3` that will have:

- same size and margin as above but given in `rem`;
- green background.

Save the colors as **variables** in some parent component (e.g. `:root`) and use them for styling.
