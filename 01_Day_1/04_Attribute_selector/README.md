## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

In the file `index.html` there is a sample page with text that contains links, and with a list of photos.


### Part 1

Mark those links that open pages in new tabs with red color. Use the appropriate attribute for this.

### Part 2

Mark images that do not have the `alt` attribute with a red border. Photos that have the `alt` attribute should have no borders or green borders.

### Part 3

At the bottom of the page there is a list of several squares. Using the attribute selector, mark with red color the elements that have the word "red" in their class.


## Exercise 2

File `index.html` contains a sample user list page.
Each user scored a certain number of points in the tournament.
Your goal will be to style the list so that you know which group a given user is in.

Style the `li` list item elements so that:
- `li` with the data-status attribute set to **bad** will have a background color **#a80e10**.
- `li` with the data-status attribute set to **medium** will have a background color **#f87641**.
- `li` with the data-status attribute set to **good** will have a background color **#7ec932**.
- `li` with the data-status attribute set to **ultra** will have a background color **#FFC107**.

All `li` elements of the list should have a **white** font color.
