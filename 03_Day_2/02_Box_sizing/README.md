## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

In file `index.html` there is a sample plan.
As you can see, the elements of the content merge together.
Your goal is to add appropriate styling to improve the appearance without changing the existing CSS.

Style the **.plan-content-left** and **.plan-content-right** elements so that:
- the text was offset from their edges by **30px**
- they had a border **1px solid #ddd**
- the layout didn't disintegrate. Use the appropriate property for this.


## Exercise 2

In the file `index.html` there is a list of articles. Your task is to improve its appearance.
First, you need to move the text away from the edges.
Add **40px** distance from the edges to the **.article-content** elements and make sure that the height of those elements does not increase.


## Exercise 3

Mark is our client and commissioned a programmer to make a simple modal of **400px** width. Unfortunately the code he received is faulty. Mark reported an issue that the modal is too wide. Examine the appropriate element in the debugger and solve the issue.
