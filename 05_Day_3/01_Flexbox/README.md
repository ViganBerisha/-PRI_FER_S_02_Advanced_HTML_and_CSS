## Holy Grail - done with the lecturer

The Holy Grail in CSS is not a famous chalice, but a problem that has given wrinkles to more than one developer in the past.

The problem was to create a fully working layout that would be based on equal columns.

Making such a layout using floats was quite a challenge and showed whether the person had reached the true Jedi level in CSS.

Your goal is to make a layout as shown below (without the texts that describe the elements) using flexbox:

## Navigation

Using your knowledge of how to arrange elements on the page, create the following page layout.

![](images/03_example.png)

Guidelines:

* Use flexbox to align the elements side by side
* Logo and navigation must be scattered (i.e. be as far apart as possible from each other)
* Logo and navigation must be at the center of the header (vertically centered)

Additional information:

* background color: #E53C3D
* text color: #492F41

## Fiery circles

The next task is to recreate the image below:

![](images/05_example.jpg)

In html, create an element `.circles` (e.g. section) and place 6 circles (e.g. as divs) in it.
Each circle should have:

- size `150x150`
- vertically and horizontally centered text (using flexbox) of the size `40px`
- distance from other circles `10px`
- gradient background changing from red to the color `#FBB921`

**The circles should be centered horizontally and wrap (fall one under the other) if they do not fit horizontally.**
